# Real Time Object Detection
Uses deep learning MobileNetSSD model and OpenCV to detect objects and people in a live camera feed. The camera feed is displayed with a box overlayed around the objects and a label for each detected object.
This code includes updates I made for a conference demo to include some funny labels when people are detected.
